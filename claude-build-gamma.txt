Convert AP Statistics Unit 5 (Sampling Distributions) to Unit 6 (Inference for Categorical Data: Proportions) by:

1. Replace all "Unit 5" with "Unit 6" in HTML title, headers, and content
2. Update exam weight: "7-12%" → "12-15%"
3. Replace all paths: "pdfs/unit5/5." → "pdfs/unit6/6."
4. Update pdfFiles array:
   - Change id: "5-n" → "6-n" for all topics
   - Change name: "Topic 5.n" → "Topic 6.n"
   - Update descriptions from knowledge-tree.md (Unit 6 topics)
   - Replace video URLs with links from urls-map.md for Unit 6
   - Update quiz PDF paths using pdf-map.txt for Unit 6
   - Update all quiz IDs: "5-n_q1" → "6-n_q1"
5. Update capstone: "5-capstone" → "6-capstone" with correct PDF paths
6. Change localStorage key: "apStatsUnit5TopicProgress" → "apStatsUnit6TopicProgress"

Note: Unit 6 has 11 topics (6.1-6.11) vs. Unit 5's 8 topics - additional topics need to be added.

Use these files for reference:
- knowledge-tree.md (Unit 6 topics & descriptions)
- media-map.md (Unit 6 video links & Unit 6 PDF mappings)
- ls-output.txt (directory structure)

Create a python program to verify all changes to ensure complete conversion with no references to Unit 5 remaining.
Done.
