I need help adapting my AP Statistics educational web materials from Unit X to a new unit. Here's what I need:

1. ANALYZE MY CODEBASE:
   - First, examine index.html to understand the structure of the web application
   - Review the Index-reference-spec.gemini.json file for detailed documentation
   - Study the current pdfFiles array to understand topic organization
   - Understand the PDF naming convention and how they relate to topics

2. RENAME PDF FILES:
   - I have PDF files with complex names (e.g., SG_TopicNameQuiz_67ec67722ed789.pdf) that need to be renamed
   - Create a Python script (rename_pdfs.py) that will:
     a) Map long topic names to topic numbers (e.g., "TopicName" â†’ "X.2")
     b) Preserve type distinctions where SG_ prefix = "answers" and TB_ prefix = "quiz" 
     c) Create a backup of original files before renaming
     d) Handle special cases like progress check files
     e) Use the simplified naming convention: "X.2_quiz.pdf" and "X.2_answers.pdf"
     f) Provide clear reporting on renamed and skipped files

3. UPDATE INDEX.HTML:
   - After renaming PDFs, modify the pdfFiles array to:
     a) Update all topic IDs, names, and descriptions based on the new unit
     b) Update PDF file paths to point to the renamed files
     c) Update video URLs using the urls-map.md file
     d) Update any unit-specific text throughout the file (titles, headers, etc.)

Available reference files:
- urls-map.md: Contains video URLs for the new unit
- pdf-map.txt: Maps original PDF filenames to topics
- ls-output.txt: Directory listing showing actual PDF filenames

Please work methodically through these tasks one at a time, explaining your approach and any modifications needed as you go.
